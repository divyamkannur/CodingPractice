# CodingPractice

* ARRAYS and VECTORS
- Array are fixed in size, while vectors are dynamic and can grow in size;
- there's no bound check while accessing array elements, but vector elements have out of bound check.
- to use vectors use #include <vector>

* C-STYLE STRING AND C++ STRING
- to use c style strings - #include <cstring>
- cystle strings are uninitialized and has garbage value.
- cstrings are fixed in size, 

- to use c style strings - #include <string>
- c++ style strings are always initialized with an empty string.
- while c++ strings are dynamic and can grow in size.

* functions with default arguments
- it is important to declare the functions with default arguments in such a way that the most changable argument is
  placed first and the least changable is kept at the last;
